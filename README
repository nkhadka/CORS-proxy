Simple proxy server to work around CORS issue.

USAGE: 

 make sure you have a relatively latest version of nodejs installed

 then do `node index.js`
 
 now, if you point any urls to your local ip address (port 3030)
   such as http://192.168.0.102:3030/<somepathhere>
   it will get relayed to  'https://bluesage-dev.bluesageusa.com'
   The server will then add proper response headers to work around CORS. 


Remember to change api calls to the local ip address before you deploy your code
