Simple proxy server to work around CORS issue.

USAGE: 

 make sure you have a relatively latest version of nodejs installed

 clone this repo,
 do `npm  install` or `yarn`

 then do `node index.js`
 
 now, if you point any urls to your local ip address (port 3030)
   such as http://192.168.0.102:3030/<somepathhere>
   it will get relayed to the url in index.js
   The server will then add proper response headers to work around CORS. 


Remember to change api calls to the local ip address before you deploy your code
